# Engage Jr

This is a basic directory build script for starting a web application engagement. It creates my preferred directory structure, creates my host files in different formats to plug into different tools depending on their needs, creates a burp file and automatically drops you into a shell at that location so that you can start testing immediately.

## Features

* Creates a basic directory structure for the specific engagement
* Creates numerous host files that can be plugged into different tools, no matter their url or hostname requirements.
* Creates a burp project for you in advance.

## Usage
```
engage_jr $NameOfEngagement $HostFile
```
